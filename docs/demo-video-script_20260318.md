## [0:00 - 0:18] HOOK — Show the WOW moment first

> "Start with the outcome they want." — Product Marketing Alliance

**Visual**: Split-screen time-lapse. Left: vibeDeploy Kanban board filling with GO ideas streaming in. Right: A live deployed app loads at `*.ondigitalocean.app`.

**Text Overlay** (large, centered, white on dark):
```
Zero prompts. Zero coding. One button.
```

**Voiceover**:
> "What if you could press one button — and AI agents discover ideas from YouTube, validate them with academic research, write type-safe code, Docker-verify it compiles, and ship a live app to DigitalOcean? No prompts. No coding. Just one click."

**Music**: Subtle electronic, builds tension.

---

## [0:18 - 0:42] PROBLEM — Establish urgency

**Visual**: Quick montage (3-second cuts):
1. Terminal showing red `tsc` errors on AI-generated TypeScript
2. A broken deployed app showing 500 error page
3. A developer staring at ChatGPT output — 20 files in one JSON blob
4. Side-by-side comparison: "Competitors: generate → hope → deploy → pray"

**Text Overlay** (appear sequentially):
```
AI code generators stop at code.
No compilation check. No type safety. No deployment.
~40% of AI-generated apps don't even compile.
```

**Voiceover**:
> "Every AI code generator today shares the same fatal flaw — they stop at code. No compilation check. No type safety between frontend and backend. No deployment. The result? About forty percent of AI-generated apps don't even compile. The gap between 'AI wrote code' and 'a real app is live' is enormous."

---

## [0:42 - 1:02] SOLUTION — One-line value proposition

**Visual**: Architecture diagram animates on screen. Each of the 6 phases lights up sequentially as mentioned: Idea → Council → Contract → Code Gen → Docker Validate → Deploy.

**Text Overlay** (bold):
```
Contract-First. Validate-Always.
Deploy success: 40% → 95%
```

**Voiceover**:
> "vibeDeploy closes the entire gap. It's not another code generator — it's an autonomous deployment platform built on DigitalOcean Gradient AI. The secret? Contract-First, Validate-Always. OpenAPI defines all types. Docker validates every build. Per-file code generation means one bad file doesn't kill twenty. Deploy success rate went from forty percent to ninety-five."

---

## [1:02 - 1:25] DEMO 1 — Zero-Prompt Start (flagship feature)

**Visual**: Screen recording of Zero-Prompt page.
1. Cursor clicks the **"Start"** button (hold for emphasis)
2. Action feed starts streaming: `[00:03] YouTube: Selected "AI Health Monitoring" (engagement: 94%)`
3. Kanban board: first card appears in "Exploring" column
4. Transcript extraction → Idea extraction → Paper search → Verdict
5. Card moves to "GO Ready" with score: 87
6. More cards accumulate (speed ramp 2x for waiting, 1x for key moments)

**Text Overlay**:
```
Zero-Prompt Start — No input required
Cost: ~$0.20 for 10 validated ideas
```

**Voiceover**:
> "This is Zero-Prompt Start. Press one button. Nine AI agents autonomously explore YouTube, extract ideas with Gemini, validate against academic papers on OpenAlex and arXiv, run competitive analysis, and score every idea. Watch GO ideas accumulate in real-time. Total cost for ten validated ideas — twenty cents."

---

## [1:25 - 1:48] DEMO 2 — Vibe Council debate

**Visual**: Screen recording of Evaluate page.
1. Type: `"Restaurant queue management with AI wait-time prediction"`
2. Press Enter → Meeting view opens
3. 6 agent cards appear with live analysis streaming (show the debate text)
4. Cross-examination: Architect and Guardian argue about scaling
5. Scoring phase → Vibe Score: 78.5 → **GO**

**Text Overlay**:
```
6 AI experts debate your idea before writing a single line of code
```

**Voiceover**:
> "Or submit your own idea. The Vibe Council — six AI agents — holds a structured debate. Architect evaluates the stack. Scout checks the market. Guardian spots risks. They actually argue with each other in cross-examination. Then the Strategist synthesizes a Vibe Score. Seventy-eight point five — GO."

---

## [1:48 - 2:22] DEMO 3 — Build Pipeline + Live Deployment

**Visual**: Dashboard pipeline view.
1. Pipeline nodes light up: Doc Gen → Blueprint → API Contract
2. Quick flash: OpenAPI spec → TypeScript types auto-generated (code on screen 2 sec)
3. Terminal overlay: `docker build... npm run build... ✓ SUCCESS`
4. Contract validation: `6/6 endpoints matched ✓`
5. GitHub repo created → DO App Platform deploying → progress bar
6. **Live URL appears**: `https://queuebite-784480.ondigitalocean.app`
7. Click URL → real working app loads with data

**Text Overlay** (sequential, bottom-right):
```
OpenAPI 3.1 → TypeScript types + Pydantic models
Docker SDK: actual npm run build in container
6/6 endpoints validated ✓
LIVE ✓
```

**Voiceover**:
> "Here's where it's fundamentally different. First, an OpenAPI spec is generated. From that single source of truth, TypeScript types AND Pydantic models are derived — frontend and backend guaranteed type-compatible. Code is generated per-file, not as a monolithic blob. Then Docker actually runs npm-run-build in a real container. If it fails, the stderr feeds back to the AI for targeted repair with temperature decay. Contract validation cross-checks every route. Only after all four tiers pass does it deploy to DigitalOcean. And there it is — live."

## [2:22 - 2:38] GRADIENT DEPTH — Show platform integration

**Visual**: Animated grid of 13 Gradient features. Each lights up with icon + one-line description + code path. Fast pace — ~1 second per feature.

**Text Overlay** (large number, centered):
```
13 DigitalOcean Gradient AI Features
```

**Voiceover**:
> "vibeDeploy uses thirteen DigitalOcean Gradient AI features — not just inference calls. ADK for agent hosting. Knowledge Bases for RAG. Evaluations, guardrails, and distributed tracing for quality. Multi-agent routing, A-to-A protocol, and MCP integration for orchestration. App Platform, Spaces, and Serverless Inference for the full stack. This is what deep Gradient AI integration looks like."

---

## [2:38 - 2:55] IMPACT + CLOSE — Sell the dream

**Visual**:
1. Four deployed apps appear side by side (QueueBite, SpendSense, PawPulse, StudyMate)
2. Each with its live URL visible and the app running
3. Zoom out → Final card:

```
   vibeDeploy
   github.com/Two-Weeks-Team/vibeDeploy
   MIT License | Open Source
   vibedeploy-7tgzk.ondigitalocean.app

   [DigitalOcean Gradient AI Badge]
```

**Text Overlay**:
```
4 apps deployed. Zero lines of code written by humans.
```

**Voiceover**:
> "Four live apps. Zero code written by a human. All running on DigitalOcean. vibeDeploy — zero prompts, zero coding, one button deploys a live app. Open source under MIT. Try it now."

**Music**: Resolves. 2 seconds of silence on final card.

- [ ] Dark mode for terminal and code segments
- [ ] 1920x1080 locked, zoom 100%
- [ ] Pre-load all pages (Zero-Prompt, Meeting, Dashboard) to avoid loading delays
- [ ] Pre-seed Kanban with some cards for visual richness at start
- [ ] Test voiceover: no echo, no background noise, clear enunciation
- [ ] Speed ramp: 1x for key reveals, 2x for waiting/building periods
- [ ] Add subtle cursor highlight effect for click emphasis
- [ ] Text overlays: white on semi-transparent dark, consistent font
- [ ] Export at exactly 2:55 (verify with YouTube after upload)
- [ ] Upload to YouTube as **Public**, **Not for Kids**
- [ ] After upload: update README and Devpost docs with the final public video URL
- [ ] Verify video plays on mobile (judges watch on phones)

## Key Principles Applied

1. **HOOK first** (0-18s) — show the WOW moment, don't build up to it
2. **Problem before solution** — make judges feel the pain, then relieve it
3. **Show, don't tell** — real screens, not slides or mockups
4. **Hybrid audio** — voiceover + text overlays (85%+ engagement vs single-mode)
5. **Technical depth through visuals** — code flashes, architecture animation, terminal output
6. **Explicit Gradient callout** — judges look for "does it thoroughly leverage the required tool?"
7. **End with impact** — 4 live apps running, MIT license, open source
